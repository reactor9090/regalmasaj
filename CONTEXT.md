Project Name: Regal Masaj
Location: Chișinău, Moldova
Language: Romanian
Goal: Create a luxury, elegant, and relaxing web experience that communicates professionalism, sophistication, and warmth — inviting visitors to schedule a massage session. The design should make visitors feel relaxed and confident, inspired by the premium experience of a high-end massage salon.

Colors (60/30/10 rule)
Primary (60%) — Background: #0B0B0B (Deep Black)
Secondary (30%) — Accent / Gold Elements: #D4AF37 (Royal Gold)
Tertiary (10%) — Text / Contrast: #FFFFFF (White)
Gold should highlight important text, borders, buttons, and accents. The black background creates depth and contrast, while white is reserved for readability and elegance.

Typography
Primary Font: Cinzel — for headings, titles, and hero text. Classical and regal aesthetic, conveying luxury and confidence.
Secondary Font: Montserrat — for paragraphs, buttons, and UI elements. Clean, modern, and easy to read; complements Cinzel’s elegance.
Typography should have ample letter spacing and breathing room for a refined, premium look.

Visual Style & Design Guidelines
Mood: Elegant, Warm, Professional, Relaxing
Hero Section: Should use a background video or high-quality image (preferably warm-toned massage scene) with gold/white overlay text.
Navigation Bar: Minimal, fixed, transparent or black with gold highlights.
Buttons: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, gold background (#D4AF37) with black or white text.
Hover Effects: Soft transitions (opacity or scale), not flashy.
Spacing: Generous padding, balanced whitespace.
Layout: Grid-based, centered, visually balanced.
Design should adapt to both desktop and mobile without losing its luxury feeling.

Responsiveness
The layout must be fully responsive and optimized for all devices. Use these standard breakpoints:

Extra small devices (phones): max-width 575px
Small devices (tablets portrait): 576px to 767px
Medium devices (tablets landscape): 768px to 991px
Large devices (laptops): 992px to 1199px
Extra large devices (desktops): 1200px and up

Responsive Adjustments:

Hero text scales down proportionally (no overflow)

Buttons stack vertically on mobile

Navigation turns into a hamburger menu on tablets and phones

Margins and padding reduce on smaller screens

Images and videos always use object-fit: cover

Functional Goals
